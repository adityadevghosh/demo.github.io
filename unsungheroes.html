  <h1>Uda Devi</h1>
  <dd>
    Uda Devi was a warrior in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, who fought against the British East India Company.
    While upper caste histories highlight the resistance contributions of upper caste heroines like Jhansi Rani, the reality was also 
    that the battles for independence from British colonial rule also featured Dalit resistance fighters like Devi.
    Devi and other female Dalit participants are today remembered as the warriors or “Dalit Veeranganas” of the 1857 Indian Rebellion.
    On seeing the rising anger of the Indian people with the British administration, Uda Devi reached out to the queen of that district,
    Begum Hazrat Mahal to enlist for war. In order to prepare for
    the battle that was headed their way, the Begum helped her form a women’s battalion under her command.When the British attacked 
    Awadh, both Uda Devi and her husband were part of the armed resistance.
    When she heard that her husband had died in the battle, she unleashed her final campaign in full force..
